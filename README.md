# SQL Filters for Security Queries

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries aimed at enhancing system security by retrieving specific login and employee information. Each query is designed to address unique security or administrative needs, such as filtering login attempts outside business hours, retrieving employee details for department-specific updates, and more. These examples demonstrate the practical application of SQL filters for managing and securing organizational data.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how SQL filters can be used for security-related tasks within an organization. By applying filters to login attempts and employee data, the organization can improve data security, quickly identify potential threats, and efficiently manage employee information.

## Queries

### 1. After Hours Login Attempts
Identifies login attempts that occurred outside of business hours (after 18:00). This query is essential for investigating potential security incidents that may occur outside regular working hours.

**SQL Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;
```

### 2. Login Attempts on Specific Dates
Retrieves all login attempts that took place on 2022-05-08 and 2022-05-09. This query assists in investigating any suspicious activities on specific dates.

**SQL Query Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-08' OR login_date = '2022-05-09';
```

### 3. Login Attempts Outside of Mexico
Filters login attempts originating from countries other than Mexico. This helps identify potential unauthorized access from foreign locations.

**SQL Query Example**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%';
```

### 4. Retrieving Employees in Marketing
Fetches details of employees working in the Marketing department in the East building, which aids in department-specific updates.

**SQL Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';
```

### 5. Retrieving Employees in Finance or Sales
Retrieves information on employees in either the Finance or Sales departments, enabling targeted updates for these departments.

**SQL Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';
```

### 6. Retrieving All Employees Not in IT
Filters out employees who are not in the Information Technology department. This query is useful for general updates that exclude IT personnel.

**SQL Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department != 'IT';
```

## Summary

This project applies various SQL filtering techniques to login and employee data. By using the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators, as well as `LIKE` and wildcard characters, these queries provide targeted insights into login activities and departmental employee information, supporting enhanced security measures and efficient system management.

## Note
The SQL queries in this repository were executed in a lab environment provided by Googleâ€™s certification program, which used `MariaDB` as the default database user. This setup does not reflect the user's personal environment and was used solely for demonstration and educational purposes.
